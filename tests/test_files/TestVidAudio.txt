Hey, Merrill. Here's my updated demo for my blog post editor and my template creator. So the first thing I'm going to show you is my blog post editor. So if I go into create new post and select a template, I use modern for this example. The first thing I've done is added AI enhance option. Now this is to optimize your prompt in here. So that way you get more out of your prompt and more out of cloud what it generates as a lot of you will may not know how to write a good structured prompt. So let me write a big prompt for you. Write a comp-re-hensive. So as you could see this is very vague. I don't give to be more detailed. It only takes a couple seconds. Here you can see what it enhanced. It gives you a target audience and hence keywords, a concept focus and suggestions applied. So basically it just gives you suggestions. So you can go through all of this, read this. You can learn from your prompt and see how to make it better. And then once you're done with that you click use optimized prompt and medically apply into here. Now once this is done you're basically ready to generate with AI and it will basically auto- full all this out. So if I click generate with AI you're going to see this is generating content. This progress bar is not finished as it just goes straight to 100% but in the backend you're going to see it still says. It's still completing using my parallel processing. So yeah, I'm going to cancel it as for the sake of this demo. So the user should be able to know how far along they are when they're generating with AI with that system as they won't have access to the backend. So once that's filled, all this post settings, all this SEO content. also going to be filled which will then this button on here will come into play. It's an SEO analysis tool so it'll analyze your entire blog post and since obviously there's nothing here so the overall SEO score of this page is zero but for the pages that already bill it will show recommendations so right here you can see it will give recommendations. You can see it counts your word count, see how dense it is, make sure it makes, basically you just make it optimized for SEO. And then I also added a grammar check, which basically just checks your entire template for any grammar issues, which also optimizes your SEO performance on that website or blog post. So yes that. Now if I go to my templates, I'm going to show you my template creator. So in my template creator you're going to see there's four grids. Now with these four grids are intended to be where your elements are placed. So if I click my header element so I can add it, element to my header. I click add text. You're going to see my text is placed in this top left. quadrant. What I have intended is you're able to drag this element to the top right, bottom right, or bottom left. I'm also going to have to add a section in the middle if you ever want text in the middle. For example, if you look at this, this text in the middle, this text is in the middle. This is one of my already created templates. So yeah, that's that. So if I go back to my template creator. You have a lot of elements to choose from. You could also select the starting quadrant edisine up here. I haven't tested all these elements but I'm gonna have to do that and there's obviously so much of errors and bugs that you still can't drag elements etc. You could also change the background of a header if you click. header and then down here is the section properties. So if I wanted the background of the setter to be red or white or whatever, you could change it easily. You could do it also do the same thing with text and the properties of the text change the text color to whatever color you want. The background of it is just all basic settings for your elements. You should leave the element if you don't. on it. This is advanced styling settings. You can choose the primary colors of your actual template. You would answer your template name and your description and once you're done with all of that, you're going to click publish and exit or save. No, this is obviously still in the works. It's super buggy and doesn't work that well, but I'm going to get, I have to fix that. But basically what this entire system is intended to do is supposed to make it so you're able to basically do everything that's in this template. There's animations, there's colors, it's all framed well. Basically just lets you create a template for your blog post that you can use. This is great for designers or whatever that are using your tool. And then... The blog post also makes the egypt
