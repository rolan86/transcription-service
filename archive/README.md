## Purpose

These documents were created during the development process to:
1. Define requirements and scope
2. Plan implementation phases
3. Document technical decisions
4. Track testing and validation

While these files are not needed for using the transcription service, they provide valuable insight into the development process and can be useful for:
- Understanding design decisions
- Contributing to the project
- Learning about the development methodology
- Future feature planning
