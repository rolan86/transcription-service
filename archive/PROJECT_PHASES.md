# Project Development Phases

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC) - Enhanced
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Validate core transcription functionality with multi-format support

### Deliverables
- Audio file transcription (MP3, WAV)
- Video file transcription (MP4 with audio extraction)
- Single file processing
- Text output to console
- Core dependencies setup

### Success Criteria
- Successfully transcribe MP3, WAV, and MP4 files
- Extract audio from MP4 videos automatically
- Achieve >80% accuracy on clear speech
- Process completes without errors for all formats

### Technologies
- `whisper` for robust transcription
- `pydub` for audio processing
- `ffmpeg-python` for video audio extraction
- Basic Python script with format detection

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Production-ready transcription service

### Deliverables
- Support additional audio formats (FLAC, M4A beyond POC MP3/WAV)
- Enhanced video file support (MOV, AVI beyond POC MP4)
- Professional CLI interface with arguments
- File output (TXT format)
- Error handling and logging
- Configuration management

### Success Criteria
- Process both audio and video files
- Handle files up to 100MB
- Provide user-friendly CLI
